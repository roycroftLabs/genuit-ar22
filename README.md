Built by Roycroft Labs on behalf of Luminous

## 💫 Set up

This project uses Node version `18.15.0`

Navigate to the project's directory and install it.

    cd genuit-ar22/
    npm install

Then run it.

    npm start

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

## 🧐 What's inside?

This site is built using Gatsby and Tailwind for styling.

Here's a quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll find inside:

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src // this is where the bulk of our code lives
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── tailwind.config.js
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

**`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of the site.

    src
    ├── components      // All shared and block-specific components live here
    ├── data            // All the site's content lives here in JSON format
    ├── images          // All images for the project
    ├── pages           // the only page for this microsite, plus a 404 template.
    ├── styles          // Some custom styles not handled by Tailwind such as complex CSS for SVG shapes and 3rd-party CSS for carousels
